/*
Maximum consecutive one's:  https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/description/

Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
*/

var findMaxConsecutiveOnes = function(nums) {
    let len = 0;
    let maxLen = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length ; i++){
        if (nums[i] == 1){
            len++;
            maxLen = Math.max(len, maxLen);
        }else{
            len = 0;
        }
        
    }
    return maxLen;
};
